# Advent of Code 2022

For my first time in Advent of Code I decided to do it in Rust.

## Source Code: (2/25) Done

Each input is stored under `./resources/dayXX` and read from by the programs.

Each day's parts can be run with cargo by running:
```zsh
cargo run --bin dayXX-Y
```
Where XX is the day and Y is the part.
